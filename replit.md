## Overview
Zepix is an automated Forex and Gold trading bot designed for integration with MetaTrader 5 (MT5) and TradingView. Its primary purpose is to execute trades based on webhook signals from TradingView, incorporating advanced risk management, sophisticated re-entry strategies, and real-time Telegram notifications. The project aims to provide a robust, automated trading solution with high customizability and control, enabling users to manage trading operations efficiently and respond to market dynamics.

## User Preferences
- **Development Mode**: Currently running in simulation mode on Replit
- **Production Deployment**: Requires Windows environment with MT5 installed
- **Webhook Integration**: Designed to receive signals from TradingView/Zepix

## System Architecture

### Core Components
The bot is built around a modular architecture comprising several key components:
- **FastAPI Server (`main.py`)**: Entry point for webhooks and API endpoints.
- **Trading Orchestration (`trading_engine.py`)**: Manages core trading logic.
- **Risk Management (`risk_manager.py`)**: Handles risk assessment and loss tracking.
- **MT5 Integration (`mt5_client.py`)**: Interface for MetaTrader 5, supporting simulation on Linux and live trading on Windows.
- **Telegram Bot (`telegram_bot.py`)**: Provides a control and notification interface.
- **Alert Processing (`alert_processor.py`)**: Validates incoming TradingView alerts.
- **Database (`database.py`)**: SQLite for persisting trade history and system state.
- **Re-entry System (`reentry_manager.py`, `price_monitor_service.py`, `reversal_exit_handler.py`)**: Implements advanced re-entry strategies including SL Hunt and TP Continuation, alongside reversal exits, with a background price monitor.
- **Trend Analysis (`timeframe_trend_manager.py`)**: Supports multi-timeframe trend validation.

### UI/UX Decisions
The primary user interface is a Telegram bot, offering extensive runtime configuration control via over 15 commands. This allows for dynamic adjustment of trading parameters, re-entry settings, risk caps, and more, without requiring a bot restart. The Telegram interface is designed for clarity with organized categories and emoji headers.

### Technical Implementations
- **Runtime Configuration Control**: Over 15 Telegram commands enable live modification of bot settings (e.g., `/simulation_mode`, `/set_monitor_interval`, `/set_daily_cap`). Changes are auto-saved to `config.json` and include input validation.
- **Advanced Re-entry System v2.0**:
    - **SL Hunt Re-entry**: Automated re-entry when price approaches SL, with alignment checks.
    - **TP Continuation Re-entry**: Chained re-entry system after Take Profit hits, featuring progressive 50% Stop Loss reduction. Auto-stops when opposite signal received.
    - **Reversal Exit Handler**: Immediate profit booking upon receiving reversal or opposite signals.
    - **Exit Appeared Early Warning**: Closes trades before SL hits when Exit Appeared alerts received (Bullish Exit = close SELL, Bearish Exit = close BUY).
    - **Background Price Monitoring**: An AsyncIO service (`PriceMonitorService`) independently monitors prices every 30 seconds.
- **Risk Management**: Features fixed lot sizes based on balance, daily and lifetime loss limits, and symbol-specific SL configurations with volatility updates.
- **Security & Compatibility**: Sensitive credentials are managed via environment variables. The bot supports a simulation mode for Linux environments (like Replit) and requires a Windows environment for live MT5 trading.
- **PnL Calculation**: Correctly uses symbol-specific pip values to prevent calculation errors.

### Feature Specifications
- **Trading Strategies**: Supports multiple distinct trading logics (Logic1, Logic2, Logic3) that can be individually toggled.
- **Symbol Mapping**: Configurable symbol mapping to support broker-specific symbol conventions (e.g., XAUUSD to GOLD).
- **Database**: Uses SQLite for comprehensive trade history, re-entry chain management, performance reporting, and system state persistence.

## External Dependencies

- **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**: The primary trading platform integration. Used for executing trades and retrieving market data.
- **TradingView Webhooks**: Receives trading signals and alerts from TradingView.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Used for sending notifications, performance reports, and receiving control commands from users.
- **SQLite**: Utilized as the database for storing trade history, re-entry chains, system settings, and other operational data.
