
ðŸ“Œ Account Size Risk Cap Briefing

Objective:

Mera goal hai ki trading me risk control ho aur lot size fixed rahe. Account size badhne ke saath SL bhi realistic aur wide rahe taki trade turant hit na ho.


---

1. Lot Size Fixed by Account:

$5,000 â†’ 0.05 lot

$10,000 â†’ 0.10 lot

$25,000 â†’ 1.00 lot

$50,000 â†’ 2.50 lot

$100,000 â†’ 5.00 lot


Lot size har account ke liye fix hai, chahe account bada ho ya chota.


---

2. Per Trade Risk (% of Account):

$5,000 account â†’ 1â€“1.5% per trade

$10,000 account â†’ 1â€“1.5% per trade

$25,000 account â†’ 2% per trade

$50,000 account â†’ 2â€“2.5% per trade

$100,000 account â†’ 3% per trade


Reason: Risk % account size ke saath increase hota hai taki SL wide rahe aur trade turant hit na ho.


---

3. Max Daily Risk & Overall Loss:

Max Daily Risk = 4% of account

Max Overall Loss = 8% of account


Isse daily ya overall capital protection rahegi aur emotional stress kam hoga.


---

4. SL (Stop Loss) Calculation:

SL per trade pip value ke hisab se calculate hota hai.

Dollar move = Lot Ã— Pip Value Ã— SL (pips)

SL ko account size aur risk % ke hisab se wide rakha gaya hai taki trade realistic ho aur risk manageable ho.



---

5. Pair Specific Notes:

FX Pairs: EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, AUDJPY

Commodities: XAUUSD (Gold)

Pip value alag-alag pairs ke liye different hai (USD-based pip value)

Table me har pair ka SL (pips) aur Dollar Move clearly diya gaya hai.
